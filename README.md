# Pop-The-Balloon-Game-using-Scratch

link- https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1032777622

i had this idea randomly and then i just started building it its my first time using scratch and i created this project just for fun 

how to play:
move your mouse over to the balloons to pop them and if you hear a crowd noise you just lost your entire score because you hit the red line at the top.  enjoy !!
